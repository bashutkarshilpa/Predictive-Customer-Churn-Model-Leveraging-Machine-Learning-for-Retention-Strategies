# Customer Churn Prediction Model

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn, which is crucial for businesses to retain their customer base. We have implemented various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision tree, bagging, random forest, Gaussian and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and gradient boosting. After extensive experimentation, we achieved an accuracy of 85.6% with the SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Preparation
- Gathered and preprocessed relevant customer data including demographics, transaction history, and interaction logs.
- Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand customer behavior and identify potential churn drivers.
- Visualized key patterns and trends in the data to inform feature selection and model development.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Engineered informative features from the raw data to capture meaningful signals related to customer churn.
- Utilized domain knowledge and statistical techniques to create predictive features enhancing model performance.

### 4. Model Selection and Training
- Evaluated various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, decision tree, bagging, random forest, Gaussian and Bernoulli Naive Bayes, KNN, SVM, and gradient boosting.
- Trained multiple models using the processed data and assessed their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning
- Fine-tuned the hyperparameters of selected models to optimize their predictive performance.
- Utilized techniques like grid search or randomized search to efficiently explore the hyperparameter space.

### 6. Model Evaluation and Validation
- Validated the trained models using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.
- Assessed model performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge predictive efficacy.

## Result
After rigorous experimentation, our SVM model emerged as the top performer with an accuracy of 85.6%. This model can effectively predict customer churn, enabling businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and reduce churn rates, ultimately fostering sustainable growth.
